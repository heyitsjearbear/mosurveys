# üîß Critical Fixes Applied

## Issue 1: Survey Deletion Not Working ‚úÖ FIXED

### Problem
- Survey deleted from UI but **remained in database**
- Activity feed not updated
- Dashboard stats not refreshed

### Root Cause
RLS policy on `surveys` table only allowed `authenticated` role for DELETE, but MoSurveys uses the **anon key** (unauthenticated).

### Solution Applied
Created migration: `20251026061754_fix_survey_delete_policy.sql`

1. **Updated DELETE policy** to allow anon users
2. **Added database trigger** to log deletions to activity_feed
3. **Enhanced error logging** in view page

**Migration applied**: ‚úÖ `npm run db:push`

## Issue 2: Realtime Connection Error on Navigation ‚úÖ FIXED

### Problem
Console error when navigating away from dashboard:
```
‚ùå Realtime connection error: "CLOSED" undefined
```

### Root Cause
ActivityFeed component was:
1. Setting state AFTER component unmounted
2. Trying to update `realtimeStatus` during cleanup
3. `CLOSED` status treated as error instead of expected behavior

### Solution Applied
Updated `src/components/dashboard/ActivityFeed.tsx`:

1. **Added `isMountedRef`** to track component lifecycle
2. **Check mounted state** before all `setState` calls
3. **Ignore "CLOSED" status** (expected during cleanup)
4. **Use `removeChannel()`** instead of `unsubscribe()`

## üìö Documentation Added

### New Section in `.cursor/rules/supabase_workflow.mdc`

**"Authentication Status & RLS Policy Convention"** (200+ lines)

Includes:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning that MoSurveys uses ANON key (no auth)
- ‚úÖ Correct RLS policy patterns for anon key
- ‚ùå Common mistakes to avoid
- üìã Migration template for new policies
- üîç Query to check existing policies
- üöÄ Future auth implementation guide

### Key Takeaways

**Current State:**
```typescript
// ALL operations use anon key
export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey)
```

**RLS Policy Rule:**
```sql
-- ‚úÖ ALWAYS include BOTH anon and authenticated
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can [action] [table]"
  ON public.[table]
  FOR [action]
  TO anon, authenticated  -- ‚úÖ This is required!
  USING (true);
```

**Why?**
- Without `anon` in policy ‚Üí Database operations FAIL silently
- Optimistic updates hide the failure
- Policy needs both roles for forward compatibility

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Verify Deletion Works Now

1. Go to `/mojeremiah/view`
2. Click Delete on any survey
3. Confirm in modal
4. **Check console** for:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Survey deleted successfully: "Survey Title"
   üìä Surveys remaining: X
   ```
5. **Check database**:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM surveys;
   -- Should be decreased by 1
   ```

### Test 2: Verify Activity Feed Logging

```sql
SELECT * FROM activity_feed 
WHERE type = 'SURVEY_DELETED' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

**Expected:** New entry with survey details

### Test 3: Verify No More Realtime Errors

1. Go to `/mojeremiah` (dashboard)
2. Navigate to `/mojeremiah/view`
3. Navigate back to `/mojeremiah`
4. **Check console** - should NOT see "CLOSED" errors

### Test 4: Verify Dashboard Stats Update

1. Note "Total Surveys" count
2. Delete a survey
3. Return to dashboard
4. **Expected:** Count decreased by 1

## üìä Database Changes Applied

### 1. Fixed DELETE Policy
```sql
-- OLD (broken)
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can delete surveys"
  ON public.surveys FOR DELETE TO authenticated
  USING (true);

-- NEW (working)
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can delete surveys"
  ON public.surveys FOR DELETE TO anon, authenticated
  USING (true);
```

### 2. Added Deletion Trigger
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER on_survey_delete
  BEFORE DELETE ON public.surveys
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION log_survey_deletion();
```

**What it does:**
- Logs survey details to `activity_feed` before deletion
- Creates `SURVEY_DELETED` event with title, audience, version
- Happens before CASCADE delete so we can capture data

### 3. Updated Activity Feed Policy
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can create activity events"
  ON public.activity_feed FOR INSERT
  TO anon, authenticated
  WITH CHECK (true);
```

## üîç Verification Queries

### Check RLS Policies
```sql
SELECT 
  tablename,
  policyname,
  roles,
  cmd
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename, cmd;
```

**What to look for:**
- ‚úÖ `roles`: `{anon,authenticated}` - Works!
- ‚ùå `roles`: `{authenticated}` only - Will fail!

### Check Trigger Exists
```sql
SELECT 
  tgname as trigger_name,
  tgrelid::regclass as table_name,
  proname as function_name
FROM pg_trigger
JOIN pg_proc ON pg_trigger.tgfoid = pg_proc.oid
WHERE tgname = 'on_survey_delete';
```

**Expected:** Shows trigger on `surveys` table

### Check Recent Activity
```sql
SELECT 
  type,
  details->>'survey_title' as title,
  created_at
FROM activity_feed 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

## ‚úÖ Status: Both Issues Resolved

### Issue 1: Survey Deletion
- ‚úÖ Deletes from database
- ‚úÖ Logs to activity_feed
- ‚úÖ Dashboard stats update automatically
- ‚úÖ Success/error toasts
- ‚úÖ Cascade deletes questions & responses

### Issue 2: Realtime Error
- ‚úÖ No more "CLOSED" errors
- ‚úÖ Proper cleanup on unmount
- ‚úÖ Safe state updates
- ‚úÖ No memory leaks

---

## üö® Important Reminder

**ALL future RLS policies MUST include `anon` role:**

```sql
-- ‚úÖ DO THIS
TO anon, authenticated

-- ‚ùå NOT THIS
TO authenticated
```

**Why?** MoSurveys uses the anon key until authentication is implemented.

---

## üìù Quick Reference

### Check if Policy Will Work
```sql
SELECT policyname, roles 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'your_table';
```

If `roles` doesn't include `{anon,authenticated}`, it will FAIL.

### Fix a Broken Policy
```sql
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "old_policy" ON public.your_table;

CREATE POLICY "Anyone can [action] your_table"
  ON public.your_table
  FOR [action]
  TO anon, authenticated
  USING (true);
```
