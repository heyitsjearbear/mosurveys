1.) 
The product’s name is MoSurveys.

2.) 
MoSurveys is an AI-powered survey management platform built for small and medium-sized businesses that want to 
understand their customers without needing a full data science or analytics team. 
It connects to Supabase for data persistence and real-time activity feeds, Vercel for deployment, and 
OpenAI’s GPT-4 mini model for AI-assisted question generation and sentiment analysis. The app enables 
the full feedback lifecycle: create, collect, analyze, and iterate — within the MoFlo Cloud ecosystem. 
Its core features include AI-powered survey creation, real-time response collection through live links and webhooks, 
and an analytics dashboard that provides sentiment analysis, response time tracking, and other insights. There’s also a 
simple version control system that allows users to manage survey versions, view changelogs, and track edits.


3.) 
I decided to make this product because it provides real business value for small and medium-sized companies 
that don’t have the resources to hire a full analytics team. It’s an affordable and automated way to gather customer 
feedback and extract actionable insights that can help improve their products and services. Instead of manually analyzing 
survey data, businesses can rely on MoSurveys to handle generation, collection, and analysis in one platform.


4.) 
MoFlo clients would be interested in this product because it integrates directly into their existing ecosystem 
of tools and simplifies how they gather and use feedback. For example, a small marketing agency using Google Forms 
might struggle to extract insights from responses stored in Google Sheets. MoSurveys automates that process by generating 
AI-powered analytics and visualizations. It also eliminates the need to switch between multiple tools like Google Forms, 
Mailchimp, or spreadsheets, keeping everything centralized within MoFlo Cloud. This makes it easier for small business owners 
to act on data quickly and confidently.


5.) 
If I had more time to improve or expand MoSurveys, I would start by implementing authentication so that each business or 
organization has its own org ID instead of everything being hardcoded. I’d also add rate limiting and better token management 
for the OpenAI API, as well as enhanced analytics such as NPS (Net Promoter Score) tracking and deeper sentiment analysis. Expanding 
the available question types would be another priority, including matrix grid questions, file uploads, and conditional branching 
based on previous responses. I’d also like to add real-time collaboration features, similar to how Google Forms allows multiple 
users to edit simultaneously. On the technical side, I’d optimize webhooks for multi-organization setups and integrate production-grade 
logging using tools like Sentry, Datadog and Trigger. Overall, these improvements would make the platform more scalable, secure, and powerful for long-term use.
