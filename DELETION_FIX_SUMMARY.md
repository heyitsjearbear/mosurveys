# 🔧 Survey Deletion - Issue Fixed!

## ❌ Problem Identified

When you deleted a survey from the UI:
1. ✅ **UI updated instantly** (optimistic update worked)
2. ❌ **Database deletion failed silently** (RLS policy blocked it)
3. ❌ **Activity feed not updated** (no trigger in place)
4. ❌ **Dashboard stats not updated** (because deletion didn't happen)

## 🔍 Root Cause

The RLS (Row Level Security) policy on the `surveys` table required `authenticated` role for DELETE operations, but you were using the **anon key** (not authenticated). This silently blocked the deletion at the database level.

```sql
-- OLD POLICY (blocked anon users)
"Authenticated users can delete surveys" → roles: {authenticated}
```

## ✅ Solutions Applied

### 1. **Fixed RLS DELETE Policy** ✅
Created migration: `20251026061754_fix_survey_delete_policy.sql`

```sql
-- NEW POLICY (allows anon + authenticated)
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can delete surveys"
  ON public.surveys
  FOR DELETE
  TO anon, authenticated
  USING (true);
```

**Note**: This is for **development only**. In production, you'll restrict this to authenticated users with proper org membership checks.

### 2. **Added Database Trigger for Activity Feed Logging** ✅
Created trigger that automatically logs deletions to `activity_feed`:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER on_survey_delete
  BEFORE DELETE ON public.surveys
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION log_survey_deletion();
```

Now when a survey is deleted:
- Activity feed gets entry: `SURVEY_DELETED`
- Includes: survey title, audience, version, timestamp
- Happens **before** cascade delete (so we can capture the data)

### 3. **Enhanced Error Logging** ✅
Updated view page with better error handling:
- Shows detailed Supabase error messages
- Logs error codes for debugging
- Displays user-friendly error toasts

### 4. **Dashboard Auto-Update** ✅
Your dashboard **already** has Realtime subscriptions that listen for DELETE events:

```typescript
// From useDashboardStats.ts
event: "*", // Includes INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
```

So stats will auto-refresh when surveys are deleted!

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Verify Deletion Works Now

1. **Open the app**: `http://localhost:3000/mojeremiah/view`
2. **Open browser console** (F12) to see detailed logs
3. **Click Delete** on any survey
4. **Confirm** in the modal
5. **Check console** for:
   ```
   ✅ Survey deleted successfully: "Survey Title" (survey-id)
   📊 Surveys remaining: X
   ```
6. **Check database**:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM surveys;
   -- Count should be decreased by 1
   ```

### Test 2: Verify Activity Feed Logging

1. **Before deletion**, check activity feed:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM activity_feed ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
   ```
2. **Delete a survey** from UI
3. **Check activity feed again**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM activity_feed 
   WHERE type = 'SURVEY_DELETED' 
   ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
   ```
4. **Expected**: New entry with survey details in JSON

### Test 3: Verify Dashboard Stats Update

1. **Open dashboard**: `http://localhost:3000/mojeremiah`
2. **Note the "Total Surveys" count** (e.g., 3)
3. **Go to view page**: `/mojeremiah/view`
4. **Delete a survey**
5. **Return to dashboard**
6. **Expected**: "Total Surveys" decreased by 1 (e.g., now shows 2)

### Test 4: Verify Cascade Deletion

1. **Pick a survey with questions** (check survey_questions table)
2. **Before deletion**:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, title FROM surveys WHERE id = 'survey-id';
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM survey_questions WHERE survey_id = 'survey-id';
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM responses WHERE survey_id = 'survey-id';
   ```
3. **Delete the survey** from UI
4. **After deletion**:
   ```sql
   -- All should return 0 or no rows
   SELECT id FROM surveys WHERE id = 'survey-id';
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM survey_questions WHERE survey_id = 'survey-id';
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM responses WHERE survey_id = 'survey-id';
   ```

## 📊 Database Verification

```sql
-- 1. Check DELETE policy (should show anon + authenticated)
SELECT policyname, roles, cmd 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'surveys' AND cmd = 'DELETE';

-- Expected: "Anyone can delete surveys" with roles: {anon,authenticated}

-- 2. Check trigger exists
SELECT tgname, tgrelid::regclass, proname 
FROM pg_trigger 
JOIN pg_proc ON pg_trigger.tgfoid = pg_proc.oid
WHERE tgname = 'on_survey_delete';

-- Expected: trigger on surveys table calling log_survey_deletion()

-- 3. Check cascade delete is still configured
SELECT 
  conname,
  conrelid::regclass as table_name,
  confdeltype as delete_action
FROM pg_constraint
WHERE confrelid = 'surveys'::regclass AND contype = 'f';

-- Expected: survey_questions and responses both show 'c' (CASCADE)
```

## 🔄 What Happens Now When You Delete a Survey

4. **Delete button shows loading** → "Deleting..." with spinner 🔄
5. **API call to Supabase** → DELETE query sent 📡
6. **RLS policy checks** → Now allows anon users! ✅
7. **BEFORE DELETE trigger fires** → Logs to activity_feed 📝
8. **Survey deleted from database** → CASCADE deletes questions & responses 🗑️
9. **Realtime event broadcasts** → Dashboard subscriptions receive event 📡
10. **Dashboard auto-refreshes** → Stats update automatically 🔄
11. **Success toast shows** → "Survey deleted successfully" ✅

## 🎯 Before vs After

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Database Deletion** | ❌ Blocked by RLS | ✅ Works (anon allowed) |
| **Activity Feed** | ❌ No entry | ✅ Auto-logged via trigger |
| **Dashboard Stats** | ❌ Not updated | ✅ Auto-updates via Realtime |
| **Error Visibility** | ❌ Silent failure | ✅ Detailed logs + toast |
| **Data Integrity** | ⚠️ Orphaned data risk | ✅ CASCADE delete verified |

## 🚨 Security Note

**Current setup allows anonymous users to delete surveys** for development convenience. 

**Before production**, you MUST:
1. Implement authentication (Supabase Auth)
2. Update the DELETE policy to:
   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "Users can delete surveys in their org"
     ON public.surveys
     FOR DELETE
     TO authenticated
     USING (
       org_id IN (
         SELECT org_id FROM user_org_memberships 
         WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
       )
     );
   ```
