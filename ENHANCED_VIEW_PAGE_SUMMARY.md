# Enhanced View Page Summary

## Branch: `enhanced-view-page`

### ✅ Completed Features

This enhancement adds powerful new features to the survey management page at `/mojeremiah/view`:

---

## 🎯 New Features

### 1. **Multiple View Modes**
Users can now switch between three different view layouts:

- **Grid View** (Default) - Card-based layout with all survey details
- **Table View** - Compact table format for scanning many surveys
- **List View** - Horizontal list items with inline actions

**Component:** `ViewModeToggle.tsx`

---

### 2. **Advanced Filtering**
Comprehensive filtering system for surveys:

- **Search** - Search by survey title, audience, or description
- **Audience Filter** - Filter by specific audience (dropdown populated from all surveys)
- **Date Range Filter** - Last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or all time
- **Clear All Filters** - Quick reset button when filters are active

**Component:** `FilterControls.tsx`

The filter state persists across view mode changes and automatically updates the count of visible surveys.

---

### 3. **Questions Preview Modal**
View all questions in a survey without leaving the management page:

- Click "Questions" button on any survey card
- Modal displays all questions with:
  - Question type and icon
  - Question text
  - Required/optional indicator
  - Options (for multiple choice)
  - Rating scale info (for rating questions)
- Fetches questions on-demand from database
- Includes loading and error states

**Component:** `QuestionsPreviewModal.tsx`

---

### 4. **View-Specific Components**

#### **SurveyTableRow** (Table View)
- Compact table row format
- Inline action icons
- Shows: Title, Audience, Version, Responses, Created Date, Actions
- All actions accessible via icon buttons

#### **SurveyListItem** (List View)
- Horizontal layout with info on left, actions on right
- Responsive - stacks vertically on mobile
- Perfect for scanning through many surveys quickly
- Shows all key info at a glance

#### **SurveyCard** (Grid View - Enhanced)
- Added "View Questions" button (purple badge)
- All existing functionality preserved
- Consistent with new components

---

## 📦 Component Architecture

All new components follow the project's modular design patterns:

```
src/components/survey/manage/
├── ViewModeToggle.tsx       # View mode switcher
├── FilterControls.tsx       # Filter inputs and controls
├── QuestionsPreviewModal.tsx # Question preview modal
├── SurveyTableRow.tsx       # Table view row component
├── SurveyListItem.tsx       # List view item component
├── SurveyCard.tsx           # Grid view card (updated)
└── index.ts                 # Clean exports
```

All components are exported from `@/components/survey/manage` for clean imports.

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Filter Logic
- Uses `useMemo` for efficient filtering performance
- Filters applied in order: version filter → search → audience → date range
- Filter state managed at page level and passed to FilterControls

### View Mode State
- View mode state persists within session
- Each view uses the same filtered data
- Smooth transitions between views

### Reusable Components
- Leverages existing common components (LoadingState, ErrorState, Toast, ConfirmModal)
- Consistent styling across all view modes
- All components follow MoSurveys design system

## 📌 Notes

### Build Error (Pre-Existing)
There's a TypeScript error in `/src/app/mojeremiah/edit/[surveyId]/page.tsx` related to missing `reorderQuestions` prop. This error exists on the main branch and is **not** related to our changes. The development server works fine.

### Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Add sorting options (by date, title, response count)
- Add bulk actions (select multiple, delete multiple)
- Add export all surveys feature
- Add survey duplication from view page
- Add keyboard shortcuts for view switching
- Persist view mode preference in localStorage

- **Table View** for quick scanning
- **List View** for compact browsing
- **Advanced Filters** for finding specific surveys
- **Questions Preview** for quick inspection
